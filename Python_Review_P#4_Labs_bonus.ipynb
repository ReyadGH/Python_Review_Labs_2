    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is to test basic input handling and error management in Python. Below are the steps to create a sush a program using try-except in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **User Input for Name:**\n",
    "   - Ask the user to enter name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Input for Age:**\n",
    "   - Ask the user to enter age.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ages Between 0 And 6 Or Less Output:**\n",
    "   - If the age is between **0 and 6**, print `\"Kid\"`.\n",
    "   - If the age is **under 0**, print `\"Wrong age value, you can not enter value 0 or less.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ages Greater than 6:**\n",
    "   - Create an empty variable `total_cost` with value of `0`.\n",
    "   - Ask the user to enter the number of items they want to buy.\n",
    "   - For each item, do:\n",
    "     - Ask for the item name.\n",
    "     - Ask for the item price.\n",
    "     - Ask the item quantity.\n",
    "     - Calculate the item total cost by multiplying the quantity by the price (`item_cost`).\n",
    "     - Update `total_cost` by adding the value of `item_cost`.\n",
    "     - Print the `item_cost` and the `total_cost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Discount Calculation:**\n",
    "   - If the `total_cost` is greater than 200, apply a discount of 20% for this and print the discounted total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling:**\n",
    "   - To handle any unexpected inputs from the user (use casting and catch errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Repetition Control:**\n",
    "   - After executing the steps above, ask the user if the user want to repeat the process from step 1 to 6.\n"
