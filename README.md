#### Lab 1 - Lists

- **Purpose**: To enhance skills in manipulating lists in Python.
- **Exercises**:
  - Sum all items in a given list.
  - Find the largest number in the list.
  - Create a new list containing only even numbers using list comprehension.
  - Use list slicing to create a new list from the first to the fifth element.

#### Lab 2 - Dictionary

- **Purpose**: To practice using dictionaries for data storage and retrieval.
- **Exercises**:
  - Build a phone book program that receives a phone number and returns the owner's name.
  - Handle various edge cases such as invalid numbers or numbers not found in the dictionary.

#### Try and Except

- **Purpose**: To implement robust programs using exception handling.
- **Exercises**:
  - Write a program that collects user input and provides responses based on age categories.
  - Calculate total costs based on user-inputted items, applying discounts for totals exceeding certain amounts.
  - Incorporate error handling to manage unexpected user inputs.
  - Allow the user to repeat the process using loops, enhancing understanding of control flow and error management.
